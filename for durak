Handle these cases. Consider disconnections from stream (stream closed) and no isAlive responses.
	- client disconnects while waiting for more players
	- server disconnects while game is running
	- client diseconnects while game is running (give chance to go back to game)
go over client and remove unnecessary usages of anonymouse functions (for ex, handleeventgamestatus - the callback)
add sign if server is reachable in starting screen
handle client afk situations
bug (create game for 4, join 2, leave both, crete new game for 2, join 2, errors)
bug (create game for two, close server, re create new game, errors)
change game end screen - show winner message and play another game button
Add piri
integrate feature so that players can add more after player decides to take cards (first come first serve)
go online for testing
make final design plan and fucking do it already

TESTING:
-----------
Create server streamer testings
Create server/stream tesings - open stream, send http requests and test stream responses
Integrate server testing for headers or bad headers
Integrate server testing for invalid payload objects
Test sending body for requests that require no payload
Test missing connection id header in requests
Test having connection id header in non wanted requests (create and join)
Go over server coverage and complete tests
Client - add tests

SERVER:
----------
Integrte logging (create game files logs for AI and wathcing and  what not...)
Remove all printings/Go over TODOs
Do not send (exactly) same event twice to client? (except for isAlive events)

CLIENT:
-----------

SECURITY:
--------------

GAME OPTIONS:
--------------
Integrate options object (client but mostly server)
Limit on cards on table
Put more than player's card limit on table and defending player can choose which ones to answer?
starting player can choose when to let other players to start adding

EXTRA FOR GAME:
-----------------
add restart mechanism - each player need to approve, if not, ask to wait for more player or start a new game
Add chat ability
Add watch game ability
add animations for double piri/hasake/etc...

UX:
-------
add error displays (replace all console.log with this...)
Add game menu change when game is over
add waiting for players
add card sorting in hand
mark defending player
mark starting player
add API in front end when finishing game, even before turn is over
add drag + magnet card when near by proper card + show places you can use on
consider adding small stats table - cards left, kozer, etc...

DESIGN:
------------
General makeover (check other durak apps)
move kozer mark at end of deck as permanent

LATER:
-----------
Make app for android/ios
Write computer AI
